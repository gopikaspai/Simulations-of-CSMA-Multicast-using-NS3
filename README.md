# Simulations-of-CSMA-Multicast-using-NS3
Multicast is group communication where information is addressed to a group of destination computers simultaneously.Multicasting can allow you to reach many end users while utilizing only one data stream, decreasing the amount of bandwidth and saving resources.
CSMA(Carrier Sense Multiple Access)is the protocol for carrier transmission access in Ethernet networks. On Ethernet each device can try to send a frame at anytime. Each device senses if the line is idle and therefore ready to sned the frame.
Here, in each CSMA Multicast scenario, I have tried to implement different topologies in Multicast networks considering CSMA protocols.
